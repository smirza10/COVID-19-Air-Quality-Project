# COVID-19-Air-Quality-Project

This folder contains some of the code that I created during my research internship.
In the similarity.py file I have the code that I used to assign a similarity score for counties to use for comparison.
In the COVID_PM_Comparsion.R file I extract the Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM25) county data and create linear regression models with the PM25 data and COVID-19 data.
